# Freya Examples

Note that this repository contains two branches. Freya provides a computation expression syntax, and also a set of operators, allowing you to work with Freya code in two styles, depending on personal preference (some people prefer more verbosity, other prefer more a more symbolic style, favouring concision).

All of the examples are provided in both of the styles - check out the appropriate branch to see the examples in your preferred style (or compare the two branches for a useful understanding of how the two styles differ).
